    <sup>Coding challenges are a great way to strengthen your problem-solving skills, coding fundamentals, and speed.<br />
    It is important to approach them with a positive mindset and not give up if you encounter difficulties. <br />
    The challenges are designed to test your real-life coding skills with some practical problems and to analyze your problem-solving abilities. <br />
    In many cases, coding challenges are timed and completed on a coding platform during the interview.</sup>
