    <p>React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library 
    that is used for building composable user interfaces (UI), especially for single-page applications. 
    It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. <br/>
    <sub>React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. 
    React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012.</sub></p>

    <p>React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. 
    A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.  
    <b>A React component is a JavaScript function that returns markup.</b> 
    Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. 
    React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.</p>
    
```js
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```
<sub>React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app.
Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. As your project grows, 
you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development.</sub>
