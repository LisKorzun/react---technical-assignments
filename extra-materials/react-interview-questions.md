<details><summary><b>What is React?</b></summary>
    <br/><p>React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library 
    that is used for building composable user interfaces (UI), especially for single-page applications. 
    It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. <br/>
    <div align='center'><sub>✧ React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ✧<br/>
    ✧ React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. ✧</sub></div></p>

<details><summary><b>What is React component?</b></summary>
    <br/>
    <p>React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. 
    A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.  
    <b>A React component is a JavaScript function that returns markup.</b> 
    Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. 
    React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.</p>
    
```js
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```
<div align='center'>
    <sup>✧ React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components”, reusable UI elements for your app. ✧<br/>
    ✧ Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. ✧<br/>✧ As your project grows, 
    you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. ✧</sup>

- React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.
- In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
- React components are regular JavaScript functions except:
  - Their names always begin with a capital letter. 
  - They return JSX markup.
