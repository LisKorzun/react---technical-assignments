<details><summary><b>What React is </b></summary><br/>
    <p>React (aka React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source front-end JavaScript library 
    that is used for building composable user interfaces (UI), especially for single-page applications. 
    It is used for handling view layer for web and mobile apps based on components in a declarative approach. <br/>
    <div align='center'><sub>‚úß React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer working for Facebook. ‚úß<br/>
    ‚úß React was first deployed on Facebook's News Feed in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. ‚úß</sub></div></p>
</details><hr/>

<details><summary><b>What a React component is</b></summary><br/>
    <p>React applications are built from isolated pieces of UI called components. 
    A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance.  
    <b><u>A React component is a JavaScript function that returns markup.</u></b> 
    Components can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page. 
    React component names must always start with a capital letter, while HTML tags must be lowercase.</p>
    
```js
function MyButton() {
  return (
    <button>I'm a button</button>
  );
}
```
<div align='center'>
    <sup>‚úß React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom ‚Äúcomponents‚Äù, reusable UI elements for your app. ‚úß<br/>
    ‚úß Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. ‚úß<br/>‚úß As your project grows, 
    you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. ‚úß</sup>
</div>
</details><hr/>

<details><summary><b>How to define a component</b> </summary>
    <br/><p>React component is a JavaScript function that you can sprinkle with markup.</p>

```js
export default function Profile() {
  return (
    <img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
  )
}

```
**Step 1: Export the component.**
The `export default` prefix is a standard JavaScript syntax (not specific to React).

**Step 2: Define the function.** 
With `function Profile() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name Profile.

**Step 3: Add markup.**
The component returns an <img /> tag with src and alt attributes. <img /> is written like HTML, 
but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called [JSX](https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.

**‚õì Return statements can be written all on one line 
or you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses.**
<div align="center">
  <sup>‚úß There are still a few rare class component use cases that do not yet have a Hook-based equivalent. 
  <br/>Class components remain supported, and are documented in the <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react/legacy">Legacy API</a> section. ‚úß</sup>
</div>
</details><hr/>

<details><summary><b>How to use components</b></summary><br/>

Once you‚Äôve defined your `ComponentA` component, you can nest it inside other components e.g. `ComponentB`.

```js
function ComponentA() {
  return <div>Component A</div>;
}

export default function ComponentB() {
  return (
          <>
            <p>Component B</p>
            <ComponentA />
          </>
  );
}
```

Because the `ComponentA` component is rendered inside `ComponentB` we can say that
`ComponentB` is a **parent** component, rendering `ComponentA` as a ‚Äú**child**‚Äù. 

**‚õì This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, 
and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.**

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;![][Recap]
- React lets you create components, reusable UI elements for your app.
- In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
- React components are regular JavaScript functions except:
  - Their names always begin with a capital letter. 
  - They return JSX markup.

<hr/>
<details><summary><b>What a ‚Äúroot‚Äù component is</b></summary><br/>

Any React application begins at a ‚Äúroot‚Äù component. Usually,
it is created automatically when you start a new project.
For example, if you use **CodeSandbox** or **Create React App**,
the root component is defined in `src/App.js`.
If you use the framework **Next.js**, the root component is defined in `pages/index.js`.

Most React apps use components all the way down. This means that 
you won‚Äôt only use components for reusable pieces like buttons, 
but also for larger pieces like sidebars, lists, and ultimately, complete pages! 
Components are a handy way to organize UI code and markup, 
even if some of them are only used once.

Still, many websites only use React [to add interactivity to existing HTML pages](https://react.dev/learn/add-react-to-an-existing-project#using-react-for-a-part-of-your-existing-page). 
They have many root components instead of a single one for the entire page.

<details><summary><b>How to import and export a component</b></summary><br/>

The magic of components lies in their reusability: you can create components that are composed of other components. 
But as you nest more and more components, it often makes sense to start splitting them into different files.

You can move a component in three steps:
- Make a new JS file to put the components in.
- Export your function component from that file (using either [default or named](https://react.dev/learn/importing-and-exporting-components#default-vs-named-exports) exports).
- Import it in the file where you‚Äôll use the component (using the corresponding technique for importing default or named exports).

<details><summary><b>Default vs named exports</b></summary><br/>

There are two primary ways to export values with JavaScript: default exports and named exports. 
You can use one or both of them in the same file. 

**‚õì A file can have no more than one default export, but it can have as many named exports as you like.**

<img src="/extra-materials/images/i_import-export.svg"/>

How you export your component dictates how you must import it. You will get an error if you try to import a default export the same way you would a named export!

- Default
  - `export default function Button() {}`
  - `import Button from './Button.js';`
- Named
  - `export function Button() {}`
  - `import { Button } from './Button.js';`
